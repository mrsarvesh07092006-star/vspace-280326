## How it works

QuadPulse generates 4 independent, jitter-free PWM signals for servo and DC motor control.
It uses a 10 MHz system clock divided into a configurable PWM period, with a phase accumulator
ramp giving 8-bit (256-step) duty cycle resolution at all frequencies.

A 3-wire SPI interface accepts 16-bit frames (2-bit channel address + 8-bit duty value) to
load duty cycles at runtime without CPU involvement. A hardware emergency stop pin
(ui_in[0]) instantly forces all outputs to zero via combinational logic — no latency.

All SPI inputs pass through 2-stage flip-flop synchronisers to prevent metastability from
the asynchronous SPI clock domain. The frequency selector is registered to suppress DIP
switch bounce. Four frequency modes are supported: 50 Hz (hobby servos), 1 kHz, 10 kHz,
and 20 kHz (silent motor drivers).

## How to test

Set the frequency with ui_in[2:1]: 00=50 Hz, 01=1 kHz, 10=10 kHz, 11=20 kHz.

Send a 16-bit SPI frame via uio[0] (MOSI), uio[1] (SCLK), uio[2] (CS_N active-low):
- Bits [15:14]: channel address (00=CH0, 01=CH1, 10=CH2, 11=CH3)
- Bits [13:8]: reserved (send as 0)
- Bits [7:0]: duty cycle (0=0%, 127=50%, 255=100%)

Observe PWM outputs on uo_out[3:0]. Connect an LED through a 470 ohm resistor to uo_out[0]
to see duty cycle as brightness without an oscilloscope. Set ui_in[0]=1 to trigger
emergency stop (all outputs go to 0 immediately, uo_out[4] goes HIGH).

Run the cocotb simulation test suite with `cd test && make`.

## External hardware

- Hobby servo (SG90 or equivalent) on uo_out[0..3] at 50 Hz
- DC motor + PWM driver module (e.g., L298N) at 1-20 kHz
- LED + 470 ohm resistor for visual duty cycle demo (no oscilloscope needed)
- Any MCU (STM32, ESP32, RP2040) as SPI master
